# Resources
Here are some great resources for furthering your learning with Node.js

We can't teach you the whole of Node in a day but hopefully we've piqued your interest and you want to learn more, but where do you start?

+ The [Node chapter of Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/20_node.html) gives some more background and challenges.
+ [learnyounode](https://github.com/workshopper/learnyounode) is an ever-popular introduction to Node.
+ [NodeSchool](http://nodeschool.io/) (the authors of learnyounode) have a lot of open source workshops and even run events globally.

There are also loads of great meetups in London aimed at encouraging people (and especially minorities) into the coding world (not necessarily JavaScript or Node):

+ [Ladies Of Code](http://www.meetup.com/Ladies-Of-Code-UK/) is a regular meetup aimed at all ladies who code (in any language) with talks and workshops.
+ [Founders & Coders](http://www.foundersandcoders.com/) is a JavaScript-based bootcamp in East London. It lasts 16 weeks and takes you to being a full stack JavaScript and Node.js developer. Join the weekly [Coding for Everyone and Coding for Women](http://www.meetup.com/founderscoders).
+ [Codebar](https://codebar.io/) has online tutorials and weekly meetups where you can sign up to have a coach for the whole evening.
+ [Women Who Code](http://www.meetup.com/Women-Who-Code-London/) is another meetup directed towards women in coding (again, any language).
+ [LNUG](http://lnug.org/) is the London Node User Group that takes place on the 4th Wednesday of every month with talks all about Node.
+ [Women Hack for Non Profits](http://www.womenhackfornonprofits.com/) is a community of women in tech building open source projects for non-profit organizations and individuals with a cause.
+ [Prosecco.js](http://proseccojs.com/) is the premier meetup for JavaScript and Prosecco-lovers in London, running networking socials for JavaScript developers to meet over sparkling wine.
